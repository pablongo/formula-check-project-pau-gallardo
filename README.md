# netRivals---Project

I have developed two solutions:

# react-solution

* It hasn't data persistance, instead I have used to redux-storage to handle the data state.
* Solution developed thinking in the future data fetching from an Api.
* Unit tests and component test examples.

# vanila-solution

* It has data persistance using a mock file as a store.
* Hasn't been tested due to similar tests on react-solution.
